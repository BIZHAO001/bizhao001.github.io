Research Fellow at the [Air Traffic Management Research Institute (ATMRI)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/atmri), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, specializing in safe and robust AI, optimization under uncertainty, multi-agent systems, and human–AI collaboration. My research develops principled AI and optimization methods for safety-critical air transportation systems, with applications in Air Traffic Management (ATM), Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), and Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM). My research has been published in leading transportation, safety, and AI journals, including Transportation Research Part C/E, IEEE T-ITS, IEEE TVT, RESS, AEI, AST, CJA, as well as at top AI conferences such as AAMAS and ICTAI. With 14 years of R&D experience in ATM/AAM and AI, my long-term research vision is to advance the transformation of air transportation systems toward autonomous, safe & resilient, and human–AI hybrid operations.

**Research Interests:** 
- Optimization under uncertainty, scheduling and routing, multi-agent coordination and learning, human–AI teaming.
